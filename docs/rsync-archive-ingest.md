# Rsync-assisted archive ingest

SeaVault uses rsync as a local ingest helper, not as an encryption layer.

The CLI command:

```bash
seavault put --method auto VAULT SOURCE [VIRTUAL_PATH]
```

prefers rsync when it is available and falls back to the native Go ingest path when rsync is missing. Use `--method rsync` to require rsync, or `--method native` to bypass rsync.

## Why rsync is not allowed to write to `.seavault`

The encrypted vault format is not a plain directory mirror. Files must be split into content-defined chunks, encrypted, authenticated, and referenced from encrypted manifests. Rsync cannot create those encrypted objects directly.

The safe design is:

```text
source file/folder
  -> rsync copies to a temporary local staging directory
  -> SeaVault reads staged files
  -> SeaVault writes encrypted chunks and encrypted manifests into .seavault
  -> staging directory is deleted
```

The cloud provider or remote transport still receives only encrypted `.seavault` objects.

## GUI modes

The GUI supports two folder workflows:

1. Browser folder upload. This uses `<input type="file" webkitdirectory>` where the browser supports it and preserves the browser-provided relative path.
2. Local path ingest. The GUI server runs locally and can read a user-provided local file or folder path. This mode supports `auto`, `rsync`, and `native` put methods.

## Security notes

- Plaintext is never written into `.seavault`.
- Rsync-assisted ingest creates a temporary plaintext staging copy on the local client and deletes it after ingest.
- The source files are already plaintext on the client; the additional local staging copy is a local endpoint risk, not a cloud/server exposure.
- Do not use rsync-assisted ingest on shared or untrusted local machines unless temporary-directory policy and disk encryption are acceptable.
- Strict remote transport remains rclone/local-copy of encrypted `.seavault` only.
